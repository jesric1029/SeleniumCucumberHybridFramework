# SeleniumCucumberHybridFramework

This is a sample framework that combines Cucumber w/ Selenium Webdriver. The example.feature contains all of the scenarios for this framework. NOTE: Do not execute this
framework by running the feature file directly. Proper use is to execute from the "RunTests" class. This is a Junit test runner that contains a before/after class methods that 
create and tear down the Selenium driver. This is important to prevent memory leaks.
