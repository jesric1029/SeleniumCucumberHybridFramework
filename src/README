This is a simple framework to demonstrate running Selenium with Cucumber.
The framework is is driven by the "RunTests" class or you can run the feature
file directly. The report can be viewed in target/cucumber-reports/index.html.

The framework simply goes to Google and searches using four different search
terms and then validates that the resulting page contains "Google" (obviously
this is not a real world case but just demonstrating the capability).

The fianl example of "firefox" is included to demonstrate how exception handling
can work into the logging.
